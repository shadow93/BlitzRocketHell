EXPERIMENTAL STUFF:

1) When a player is killed, they drop a reanimator so that any alive medics have a chance to revive dead players. (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)

2) Attempting to switch from SpawnWeapon to itemOverride=PrepareItemHandle without interfering with FF2's default itemoverride.

3) Switching from teamplay_round_start to arena_round_start for better results. (implemented)

4) Switching from teamplay_round_end to arena_win_panel for better results. (implemented)

5) Drain over time rages (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
