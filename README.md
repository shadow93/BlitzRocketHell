The Blitzkrieg TF2 Danmaku Platform

* EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH
 * All tweaks subject to change before a release version is out

Essentially an expansion plugin platform for Freak Fortress 2 to introduce the Japanese Danmaku-style combat style.

Whether the "Danmaku" Boss has an alternate weapon is an option, but this base plugin is a WIP, with only 1 boss - The Blitzkrieg.

Difficulty levels are recommended so that certain versions of "Danmaku" bosses are less predictable than others and would sport their own unique abilities. As an example, Blitzkrieg's unique ability is to be able to gain critical hits when raging and complete uber/crits when he loses a life.

Suggested amount of projectile weapons is 10, but can be more or less.

For rocket-launcher danmaku, only spy-bosses do not qualify as they go on a reference pose. All other classes are fine.

Customize to your own liking, it is an open source platform plugin for potential "Danmaku" freaks for Freak Fortress 2.

Custom weapons are also recommended as a balance method for the Danmaku bosses's attributes. Blitkrieg has Medics' mediguns upgraded with projectile shields, Engineers get 2-way teleporters, and Soldiers get a modified rocket launcher to aid them in rocket jumping to new heights.

Please do help make this platform grow! Any contributions will be appreciated!
