The Blitzkrieg TF2 Danmaku Platform

EXPERIMENTAL STUFF (1.78):

1) When a player is killed, they drop a reanimator so that any alive medics have a chance to revive dead players. (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)

2) Improved method to assigning custom weapons (itemoverride handle was a fail sadly)

3) Switching from teamplay_round_start to arena_round_start for better results. (implemented)

4) Switching from teamplay_round_end to arena_win_panel for better results. (implemented)

5) Drain over time rages (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

6) Killfeed icon now registers as being a meteor shower spell kill! (implemented)

7) Config changes & ability changes!

8) Rampage timer only used to switch weapon if configuration is set to Danmaku Only. Mixed combat mode reverts to melee when last
of ammo is exhausted.

9) Uses one timer to restore gravity, can be extended if able to rage before the timer expires

10) If difficulty is set to 0, it will randomly select a difficulty level.

11) Once round starts, a notification on the chat will indicate The Blitzkrieg's current difficulty level

12) Death Effect: Changes the boss class between Soldier & Medic while still using the same current boss model, for the voice response/command changes.
