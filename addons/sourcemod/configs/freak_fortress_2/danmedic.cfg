// Freak Fortress 2
// ================
//
// SHADoW93's Danmaku Medic - AKA the Blitzkrieg
// The Freak Fortress 2 Rocket Hell concept boss i've shown on youtube.
//
// Special thanks to Ravensbro for the new model!
//
// Difficuly: Normal-Extreme (Depends on setting)
// Health: Normal, distributed through 5 lives
// Super Jump: Normal load/cooldown
// Melee: Ubersaw with Backstabbing capability and Professional Killstreak Kit
// Rage: Blitz (spawns 1 of 10 rocket launchers at random with 360 rockets for ammo)
// Rage Info: Unleash a barrage of danmaku upon players.
// When you rage, you are given 1 of 10 modified rocket launchers with a 
// professional killstreak kit. The launcher's
// clip size will vary depending on damage and speed. 
// Once you release fire, all the rockets will be unleashed, creating a barrage of 
// rockets.
//
// Death Effect: Blitzkrieg
// Death Effect Info: Become ubercharged and kritzkrieged for 13 seconds and switch
// to a more powerful rocket launcher wiht 360 rockets for ammo, bringing even more
// difficult danmaku! You will float around for a pre-defined amount of time.
//
// Playing as The Blitzkrieg?
// Your ubersaw is capable of backstabbing! You can quickly eliminate enemies caught
// off-guard or finish off trapped players. Your rage gives you one of 10 rocket launchers.
//
// When you lose a life, you gain uber and crits for 13 seconds. You can wipe out enemies with
// the rocket launcher from a distance, or finsh off nearby players. The rocket launcher
// given on a loss of life is more powerful than the rocket launcher given on-rage, so use it
// with your crits to wipe out engy nests!
//
// Playing against The Blitzkrieg?
// Scout:
// Using your speed and super jump, you can dodge his rockets easily as they travel slowly,
// and try to hit him from an angle where he is not aiming at. If you have a fan-o-war,
// use that to your advantage to reduce his chance of being able to rage too soon as it takes
// approximately 700HP to rage. Just avoid getting backstabbed doing this!
//
// Soldier:
// His rockets deal very little damage, so you can try to gain crits with your Reserve Shooter,
// if he fires while airborne. You can survive a barrage of rockets if you have the Concheror 
// and Half-Zatoichi combined. Your B.A.S.E jumper can come in handy to buy you some time.
// You can rocket jump and fly in the air to counter-attack!
// You are given a special rocket launcher to be able to counter-attack with infinite ammo!
//
// Pyro:
// Since his rockets travel around the same speed as Bionic Commando's, you can deflect a large
// amount of rockets, especially crockets using your airblast ability.
//
// Demoman:
// If you have the B.A.S.E jumper equipped or the Half-Zatoichi, use this to your advantage.
// If you have a shield equipped, use it to your advantage to dodge his barrage of rockets.
// Other demoman tatics can be used.
//
// Heavy:
// You have the largest amount of health!
// You can use the Gloves of Running urgently to dodge his rockets.
// You can also use any Sandvich to restore health after dealing a barrage of rockets
// to yourself, or to your teammates. Other heavy tatics can be used to deal against him.
// 
// Engineer:
// Normal engineer tatics can be used to deal against him. If you have a Eureka Effect,
// use this to your advantage to escape the rocket barrage quickly!
// Your teleporters are equipped to be bi-directional!
//
// Medic:
// You are a valuable asset to your team! When you pair an ubercharge with a pyro,
// this becomes a perfect opportunity for the pyro to airblast a bulk amount of rockets 
// as the uber converts all deflected rockets into crockets, becoming a deadly pair.
// Use +attack3 to activate your projectile shield
//
// Sniper:
// Normal sniper tatics can be used to deal againt him.
//
// Spy:
// While he is using the rocket launcher, he is unable to use his melee weapon until
// the last rocket is unloaded, so backstabbing opportunities are ripe! if you have a 
// dead ringer, use it to your advantage!
